---------------------------
The fit is given by:
4.95867*x^0-0.171379*x^1

The value of c1 is -0.171379.
 
The estimation of the value for the half-life is 4.04452 days +/- 0.202226 days =  [4.24674 3.84229] days

The correct value is 3.6319 days. The two half-lives do not agree.

The covariance matrix is

    [	0.0009	-9e-05
	-9e-05	1e-05	]
